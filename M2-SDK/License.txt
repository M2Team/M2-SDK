M2-SDK 使用 MIT 协议发行。
M2-SDK is distributed under the MIT License.

M2-SDK 提供了大量的 Windows 内部 API 定义和一些实现。该部分基于以 GPL v3 协议发
行的Process Hacker的PHNT库。
The M2-SDK contains a large number of Windows Internal API definitions and some
implementations for that. This part is based on PHNT library in Process Hacker 
which is distributed under the GPL v3 License.

为了避免以 GPL v3 协议发行作品，于是我通过邮件获取了作者的许可。我通过Outlook 
2016保存了邮件，详见M2.PHNT.msg。
To avoid distributing the work under the GPL v3 License, I have got the 
author's permission via email. I saved the email by the Outlook 2016, see 
M2.PHNT.msg. 

为了向作者表示感谢，这也是为什么发布 M2-SDK 的原因。
In order to show appreciation to the author, this is why I release M2-SDK.
